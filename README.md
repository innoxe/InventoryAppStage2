# InventoryAppStage2
Inventory App project from course ABND by Google in Udacity. The goal is to design and create the structure of an Inventory App which would allow a store to keep track of its inventory. 

In addition to skills covered in previous courses, this project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

- Storing information in a SQLite database
- Integrating Android’s file storage systems into that database
- Setting up a Content Provider and use it to access a repository of data
- Presenting information from files and SQLite databases to users
- Updating information based on user input
- Creating intents to other apps using stored information
